## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a detail-oriented professional transitioning from a sales support role into data analytics, driven by a strong interest developed through hands-on experience in a previous position. I hold a Bachelor of Science and a Graduate Certificate in Data Science Fundamentals, and I am currently pursuing a Certificate in Data Analytics through a boot camp-style program with Generation Australia.

I have experience in stakeholder communication, working with sales data in Excel, and creating pivot tables for reporting. Recently, Iâ€™ve developed skills in Excel, Python, SQL, Statistics, and Power BI through formal training and personal projects.

Please feel free to explore the projects Iâ€™ve created, where Iâ€™ve showcased these skills in action :-)
